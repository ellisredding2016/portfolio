				<h1> About Me </h1>
				<p>My name is Aaron Rowan.  I am a web developer and programmer in the Charlotte, NC area.  I work mostly in Microsoft .NET technologies such as C#, VB.NET, ASP.NET, I am also very familiar with JavaScript, jQuery, CSS3, HTML5, SQL Server (both Microsoft and Oracle), AJAX, C and some wireless communication protocols for the XBee.</p>

				<p>I’ve been programming since I was 5 years old on my family’s Tandy Color Computer 80.  The true computer prototype, this unit used our TV and had it’s 5 ½” floppy drive connected via an external ribbon cable.  I created programs in BASIC to create simple, interactive images on the screen and output and modulate sound.  </p>

				<p>Thus far in my career, I have focused on developing streamlined and efficient processes.  I’ve been developing my IT skills through my extensive project and process work, developing a number of applications specifically designed to the needs of my employers.  Now in Charlotte, I’m presented with a healthy job market and an opportunity to really focus on the skills I have been less formally developing for the past 30 years.</p>

				<p>I love solving problems and have had some excellent success volunteering.  I was the lead engineering mentor for a regional high school robotics team.  We received the rookie achievement award for our dedication and relentless approach to creating and maintaining our robot throughout the Philadelphia Alliance Regional at Drexel University.</p>
